Report 4: Deep Hull Maritime Surveys
Inspection Report: Deep Hull Maritime Surveys
Date: 28-February-2025
Inspection Team:

Captain Robert Sterling, Marine Surveyor
Dr. Lisa Chen, Underwater Hull Specialist

1. General Assessment
The aft hull section and propeller housing area show continued good structural performance. The unique six-bladed propeller and stern frame assembly remain in excellent condition for display and educational purposes.
2. Stern Section Analysis
Inspection Tools Used:

Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) for underwater inspection
Ultrasonic thickness measurements
Propeller shaft alignment laser system
Stern frame stress analysis equipment

Observations:

Rudder assembly maintains proper alignment with minimal play in bearings
Propeller blades show uniform condition with original bronze material in excellent state
Stern frame exhibits typical age-related material loss but remains structurally sound
Propeller shaft housing shows effective seal performance with no water ingress

3. Propulsion System Assessment
Stern Frame Condition:

Iron frame thickness: 11.2mm average (original: 12.5mm)
Rudder bearing clearance: 0.8mm (acceptable: <2.0mm)
Structural alignment: Within 0.5 degrees of design specification

Propeller Analysis:

Bronze propeller mass: 3,847kg (original specification: 3,890kg)
Blade tip clearance: Uniform within Â±2mm tolerance
Surface condition: Excellent with stable patina formation
Hub assembly: Secure with no detectable movement

4. Measurements and Observations
Structural Measurements:

Stern post verticality: 0.3 degrees deviation (acceptable: <1.0 degree)
Hull plate thickness at stern: 8.9mm average
Propeller shaft bearing wear: 0.2mm (replacement threshold: 1.5mm)

Hydrodynamic Features:

Hull form accuracy: 98.7% match to original lines drawings
Propeller clearance to hull: Maintained at design specifications

5. Recommendations

Stern Frame: Continue annual structural monitoring with current inspection protocol
Propeller System: Maintain protective treatments for bronze components
Documentation: Update 3D scanning records for any detected changes

Inspector's Notes: The aft section represents one of the best-preserved examples of mid-19th century marine propulsion technology. The engineering integrity remains impressive.
