Michael Harrison, Marine Engineer
Dr. Patricia Adams, Industrial Heritage Specialist

1. General Condition
Overall Status: The historic steam engine and associated machinery continue to be well-preserved display pieces. While not operational, the mechanical systems maintain their educational and historical value through careful conservation.
Inspection Tools Used:

Precision measuring instruments for component assessment
Borescope for internal cylinder inspection
Materials testing for metal fatigue analysis
Environmental monitoring for climate control effectiveness

2. Steam Engine Assessment
Main Engine Components:

Cylinder bore condition excellent with original honing marks visible
Piston and connecting rod assembly showing appropriate preservation treatments
Crankshaft alignment within manufacturing tolerances despite age
Valve gear mechanisms demonstrating original engineering precision

Boiler Systems:

Fire tubes maintain structural integrity with effective preservation coatings
Boiler shell external condition good with localized surface treatments needed
Pressure vessel components safely disabled while maintaining historical appearance
Steam piping systems complete and properly supported

3. Machinery Space Environment
Climate Control:

Engine room temperature: 18.5°C (target: 18-22°C)
Relative humidity: 55% (target: 50-60%)
Air circulation: Adequate with no stagnant areas detected
Lighting levels appropriate for visitor viewing and conservation

Mechanical Systems:

Original tool and equipment placement maintained
Interpretive equipment functioning properly
Visitor viewing areas safe and properly marked
Emergency systems meet current safety standards

4. Technical Measurements
Engine Component Analysis:

Cylinder bore diameter: 2,134mm (within 0.1% of original specification)
Piston stroke measurement: 1,829mm (matches design drawings)
Flywheel diameter: 5,486mm (original specification maintained)
Main bearing clearances: Documented for historical record

Preservation Effectiveness:

Coating adhesion: 96% effective coverage
Metal surface stability: Excellent with stable patina
Component movement: All inspection points accessible

5. Recommendations
Engine Room Environment:

Continue current climate control regiment
Schedule deep cleaning of less accessible areas annually
Maintain visitor education programs highlighting engineering significance

Mechanical Systems:

Document any component changes for historical accuracy
Consider additional protective barriers for high-value components
Plan specialized conservation treatments for areas showing environmental stress

Inspector's Notes: This engine room represents an outstanding example of early steam marine propulsion. The preservation quality allows visitors to understand the revolutionary engineering that made SS Great Britain possible.
