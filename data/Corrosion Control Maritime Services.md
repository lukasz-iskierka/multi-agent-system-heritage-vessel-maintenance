Report 2: Corrosion Control Maritime Services
Inspection Report: Corrosion Control Maritime Services
Date: 15-February-2025
Inspector: Dr. James Morrison, Marine Corrosion Engineer
1. Overview
The midship hull section corrosion management systems are performing effectively. Recent protective coating applications are showing good adhesion and coverage, with only localized areas requiring attention.
Inspection Tools Used:

Holiday detector for coating continuity testing
Electrochemical corrosion rate probe
pH testing kit for environmental assessment
Digital microscopy for surface analysis

2. Findings
Port Midship Hull:

Protective coating coverage: 94% effective
Active corrosion rate: 0.12mm/year (acceptable threshold: <0.2mm/year)
Minor coating holidays detected at 6 locations, totaling 0.8m² area
No undercutting corrosion observed beneath existing coatings

Starboard Midship Hull:

Protective coating coverage: 91% effective
Active corrosion rate: 0.18mm/year (approaching threshold)
Galvanic corrosion noted at bronze propeller shaft bearing interface
Surface preparation quality remains good in recently treated areas

3. Environmental Measurements
Corrosion Rate Monitoring:

Port midship: 0.12mm/year
Starboard midship: 0.18mm/year
Propeller shaft area: 0.31mm/year (above threshold)

Environmental Factors:

Relative humidity: 65% (target: <70%)
Chloride contamination: 2.1 mg/m² (acceptable: <5.0 mg/m²)
Surface pH: 6.8 (neutral range)

4. Recommendations

Immediate Action: Address galvanic corrosion at propeller shaft bearing within 60 days
Coating Maintenance: Spot-repair coating holidays during next scheduled maintenance
Monitoring: Increase corrosion rate monitoring frequency for starboard areas

Inspector's Note: Overall corrosion management is effective, with the ship's iron structure showing excellent preservation for its age.
