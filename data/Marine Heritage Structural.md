Report 1: Marine Heritage Structural Ltd.
Inspection Report: Marine Heritage Structural Ltd.
Date: 22-March-2025
Inspection Team:

Dr. Emma Watson, Naval Architecture Specialist
Thomas Richardson, Iron Ship Structural Engineer

1. General Assessment
The forward hull section of SS Great Britain shows satisfactory structural integrity overall. The iron plating and riveted construction continue to perform well, with only minor issues requiring attention during the inspection period.
2. Hull Plating Analysis
Inspection Tools Used:

Ultrasonic thickness gauge for plate measurements
Endoscope camera for internal frame inspection
Digital caliper for rivet head assessment
Magnetic particle testing for crack detection

Observations:

Iron plate thickness ranges from 8.2mm to 9.1mm, showing minimal material loss since last inspection
Original rivets show good retention, with 98% exhibiting proper head formation
No structural cracks detected in primary load-bearing frames
Slight deformation (2.3mm maximum) noted in starboard bow plating, consistent with historical settling

3. Structural Measurements
Hull Plate Thickness:

Port forward: Average 8.7mm (original specification: 9.5mm)
Starboard forward: Average 8.4mm (original specification: 9.5mm)
Centerline: Average 9.0mm (original specification: 9.5mm)

Rivet Condition:

Total rivets inspected: 847
Loose rivets identified: 12 (1.4%)
Severely corroded rivet heads: 23 (2.7%)

4. Recommendations

Hull Plating: Continue quarterly monitoring, particularly starboard sections showing higher material loss
Rivets: Replace 12 loose rivets during next maintenance window
Structural Monitoring: Install additional strain gauges on forward frames for continuous monitoring

Inspector's Notes: The ship's structural condition reflects excellent preservation practices. The iron construction continues to demonstrate remarkable durability after 182 years.
